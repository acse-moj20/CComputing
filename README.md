# My Introduction to Cloud Computing 
Just teaching myself cloud computing

## Cloud Computing
- Definition: model for enabling convenient,on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resourcesthat can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

- Cloud model: 5 essential characteristics, 3 deployment models and 3 service models.
- 5 Characteristics: 
   - On demand self service 
   - Broad network access (through standard mechanisms)
   - Resource pooling (gives economies of scale making cloud cost-efficient). Dynamically assign resources based on demand.
   - Rapid elasticity: access resources when you need them and kepp them away when you do not.
   - Measued service: if you are not using, you are not paying.
   
- 3 Deployment Models:
  - Public: leverage cloud services over the internet over hardware owned by the provider but usage is shared by others. 
  - Private: infrastructure is for exclusive use by a single organization. Options are run-on-premises or provisioned by a service provider.
  - Hybrid: mix of public and private.
  
- 3 Service Models (based on layers in a computing stack):
  - Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas): access to infrastructure and physical resources such as servers, networking, storage and data centers w/o needing to manage or operate them.
  - Platfrom as a Service (Paas): access to infrastructure and physical hard/soft ware tools needed to deploy applications to users over the internet. 
  - Software App as a Service (SaaS): software licensing and delivery model in which software and apps are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis ("on-demand software")
