# My Introduction to Cloud Computing 
Just teaching myself cloud computing

## Cloud Computing Basics
- Definition: model for enabling convenient,on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resourcesthat can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

- Cloud model: 5 essential characteristics, 3 deployment models and 3 service models.
- 5 Characteristics: 
   - On demand self service 
   - Broad network access (through standard mechanisms)
   - Resource pooling (gives economies of scale making cloud cost-efficient). Dynamically assign resources based on demand.
   - Rapid elasticity: access resources when you need them and kepp them away when you do not.
   - Measued service: if you are not using, you are not paying.
   
- 3 Deployment Models:
  - Public: leverage cloud services over the internet over hardware owned by the provider but usage is shared by others. 
  - Private: infrastructure is for exclusive use by a single organization. Options are run-on-premises or provisioned by a service provider.
  - Hybrid: mix of public and private.
  
- 3 Service Models (based on layers in a computing stack):
  - Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas): access to infrastructure and physical resources such as servers, networking, storage and data centers w/o needing to manage or operate them.
  - Platfrom as a Service (Paas): access to infrastructure and physical hard/soft ware tools needed to deploy applications to users over the internet. 
  - Software App as a Service (SaaS): software licensing and delivery model in which software and apps are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis ("on-demand software")
  
## Emerging Technologies Accelerated by Cloud
These include new era technologies that are disrupting business models and industries while creating unprecendented opportunities for businesses to stand out and create value. 
Some of these technologies include:
- Internet of Things: IoT is a giant network of connected of things and people. Smart devices/sensors are continously tracking and collecting data putting a strain on the identity. The IoT user cna be connected to the cloud for purposes such as device registratio, identity, data storage or enterprise data access. The cloud can store and process IoT data from the devoces servign as a collection point and minimizing latency while providing feedack to the connected devices. Special service can be designed to speed up, support or enable the development of IoT solutions.
